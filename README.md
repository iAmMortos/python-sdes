An implementation of SDES (Simplified DES) in Python for academic purposes with a fully verbose output mode to show the operations at each step.

SDES takes an 8-bit message and a 10-bit key to produce an 8-bit cipher text.

This SDES implementation is then used in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) and Cipher Feedback (CFB) modes to demonstrate encrypting strings of messages.
